The artist was playing around with Lissajous Curves, following a [course about differential geometry by Edmund Weitz](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0zKSynM2PD3i3xMuWrUF9_txMrJMGEZ). The number of segments that constitute the curve stay the same â€“ so the longer the curve gets, the bigger the parts get that one segment has to cover. This is why the curve starts out fine and smooth, but after a few rounds, it gets more and more spikey.

It is written completely in p5.js.
